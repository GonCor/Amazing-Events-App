Welcome to Amazing Events App
This is an exciting project for the development of an app for Amazing Events. The project will involve developing the app from scratch, and we are excited to have you on board as part of the development team.

To ensure that we can fully utilize your skills and abilities, we kindly request that you complete some JavaScript exercises and send them to us for review. This will help us assess your proficiency in the language and determine the best way to utilize your skills for the project.

We are still working with Amazing Events to clarify the project goals, and we will provide you with more details as soon as possible. In the meantime, we encourage you to brush up on your JavaScript skills and prepare to amaze us all with your coding prowess!

Thank you for joining us on this exciting project.

Best regards,
Paula Davis
