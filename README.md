The website has several pages:

Home: displays all events in a summarized form, both past (colored with a gray filter) and upcoming. Events are shown with information such as category, image, date, description, price, and location. There are also filters by category and a search field that can be used to find specific events.
Upcoming events: shows the events that are yet to happen, with the same filters and search field as found on the home page.
Past events: similar to the upcoming events page, but only for past events.
Contact: a form for contacting and sending messages.
Stats: displays a table with statistics from past events, such as maximum and minimum attendance and the event with the highest capacity. There are also revenue statistics and percentage attendance grouped by category for both past and upcoming events.
Details: this page shows more detailed information about the event, in addition to the aforementioned data. It includes an estimate of event attendance and capacity.
External API
All event data is obtained from an external API and loaded onto the page through a "fetch" request.
